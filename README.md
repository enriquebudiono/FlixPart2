### Notes
The challenge that I got when making the unit 2 is where I need to comfigure the tab bar where there is a slight problem with the code when I code it. The video also told me that if I delete a Label that I drag from screen to the code, I cannot just simply delete it from the code but also I need to delete it from the screen also.

### Notes
When building the app, it's really interesting how the code realy works. The part where I got struge is when adding coding from the API to the program itself which is a little bit confusing because inside the video, the instructor show a sudden content for the navigation controller where I'm going to use for the title in the app.
